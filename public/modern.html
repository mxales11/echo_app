               "Carlos Acosta celebrates his fortieth birthday this year, and while he might no longer have the full-on flying swagger he landed in London with in the '90s, the Cuban is still one heck of a dancer. No-one can turn on the charm and charisma quite like Carlos, and in this retrospective show he'll be revisiting some of his favourite roles from the classical and neo-classical canon".
